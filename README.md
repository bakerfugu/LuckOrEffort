Explore this interactive comparison of luck and skill! 

In [January of 2020](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-newest-astronauts-ready-for-space-station-moon-and-mars-missions) NASA selected 11 people to become astronauts out of the more than 18,300 people who applied. Did the 11 astronauts get a little lucky or was it solely a result of hard work?

Run it on repl.it to see what happens! - https://repl.it/@Baker_WilliamWi/LuckOrHardWork

Experiment with different numbers, or change the effort/luck weights using EFFORT_WEIGHT and LUCK_WEIGHT. 

Possible statistics to experiment with:
 * Select the [number of Stanford admits](https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/selection/statistics.html) from the [number of college freshmen that year](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_305.10.asp).
 * Select the number of billionaires in the US from the population of the US.

Some questions for reflection:
 * What do the results of this simulation say about the possible effects of luck and skill in highly selective programs? 
 * In what ways can this simulation be misleading?
 * What successes have you had that were supported by luck and circumstance?
