This is a interactive simulation of a simplified comparison of luck and skill. For example, in [January of 2020](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-newest-astronauts-ready-for-space-station-moon-and-mars-missions) NASA selected 11 people to become astronauts out of the more than 18,300 people who applied. Did the 11 astronauts get a little lucky or was it solely a result of hard work?

Experiment with different numbers, or change the effort/luck weights using EFFORT_WEIGHT and LUCK_WEIGHT. 

Possible questions to explore:
 * How lucky are Stanford admits? Select the [number of Stanford admits](https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/selection/statistics.html) from the [number of college freshmen that year](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_305.10.asp).
 * How lucky are billionaires? Select the number of billionaires in the US from the population of the US.
